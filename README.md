# Cracking the Apple: Predicting Stock Prices

This project aims to analyze and predict Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock prices using time series models and machine learning algorithms. The notebook contains steps for data collection, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and predictive modeling.

## Project Structure

- `cracking-the-apple-predicting-stock-prices.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook with code, visualizations, and models.
- `requirements.txt`: Python packages required to run the notebook.
- `README.md`: Overview and instructions for the project.

## Features

- Fetching historical stock price data using `yfinance`
- Visualizations for EDA
- Feature engineering on date/time features
- Model training and evaluation (e.g., Linear Regression, LSTM, or other models)
- Prediction plotting

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Install required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the notebook

Open the notebook using Jupyter:

```bash
jupyter notebook cracking-the-apple-predicting-stock-prices.ipynb
```

Make sure you have internet access for fetching data from APIs like Yahoo Finance.

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- The dataset is dynamically fetched via `yfinance` (no need to manually download stock data).
- You can change the ticker or date range in the notebook for other stocks.
